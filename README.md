### 💬 Anonymous Confessions

Users submit confessions via slash command only (for anonymity). Every confession is analyzed for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, concerning). Admins can require approval, enable auto-approval for positive confessions, and review queued confessions with approve/reject buttons. Every posted confession gets a discussion thread.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/confession <message>` | Submit an anonymous confession (10–2000 characters) |
| `/confession-setup` | Configure confession settings **(admin only)** |
| `/confession-view <id>` | View a confession by ID **(admin only)** |
| `/confession-history` | List confession history with First/Previous/Next/Last pagination **(admin only)** |

**Setup (admin):** Use `/confession-setup` with action **Enable** to turn on confessions and set the confession channel. If you want review before posting, set **approval required** and the **admin channel**; you can optionally enable **auto-approve** so positive confessions post without review.

**Workflow:**
- **No approval required:** Confession is posted to the confession channel and a thread is created; you get an ephemeral confirmation.
- **Approval required, auto-approve on:** Positive confessions are posted and a thread is created; others go to the admin channel for review.
- **Approval required, auto-approve off:** All confessions go to the admin channel; admins use ✅ Approve / ❌ Reject. Approved confessions are posted and get a thread; you are notified by DM when your confession is approved or rejected.

**Confession history:** Admins use `/confession-history` to see a paginated table (ID, Status, Submitted by, Sentiment, Preview, Submitted) and use **First**, **Previous**, **Next**, **Last** buttons to move between pages.
